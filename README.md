Pawtograph is the social media app for pets. Pet owners can create accounts for their pets, sharing their photos and thoughts with other pet owners, or should I say, with other pets. You can post, follow, message, and interact with posts by liking and commenting. Real time notification also exists on following, liking, commenting or replying to a comment. Owners can mark their pets as "For adoption" if, for some reason, they can't keep their pet with them anymore. Lost your cat ðŸ˜Ÿ ? We got your back, you can mark your pet as "Lost" from the settings so others can contact you if they can help.
